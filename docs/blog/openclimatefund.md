We're launching **[OpenClimate.fund](https://openclimate.fund/)**, a community-driven initiative to support open source projects that address climate change and biodiversity loss. These are among the most pressing challenges of our time, yet open source efforts in these areas remain alarmingly underfunded. While significant resources are being spent on areas such as artificial intelligence and security, the environmental sector is largely left empty-handed when it comes to open source solutions. It's time to change that.

OpenClimate.fund aims to bridge this gap by funding an ecosystem built on transparency, trust, and collaboration to advance climate-friendly technologies and measurable environmental impact.

## A Community-Driven Funding Approach 

In our first funding round, we’re introducing a **“positive snowball system"** to empower the community and drive meaningful change. Here’s what you can do:

1. **Identify a high impact project missing** in the [OpenSustain.tech](https://opensustain.tech/) directory.
2. **Submit it through our review process** using the [Contributing Guide](https://opensustain.tech/contributing/), which outlines the steps for nominating impactful open source initiatives. 
3. **Nominate another project** from the [directory](https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/gSscJkc5Rb1Rw45gh1o1Yc/p/5) to receive a 100€ gift and a heartfelt thank-you message.

To minimize overhead, this initial round will focus on projects that have been active within the last four months and accept donations through the platforms Open Source Collective or GitHub Sponsors. Despite rigorous data mining with our partner **Ecosyste.ms**, only 84 eligible projects have been identified so far at the date of launch — underscoring the urgent need for this initiative. Our own experience has also shown us that donations in this area are so rare that many projects don't even bother to ask for them. If your project is already listed but not yet proposed, simply add donation information about your GitHub organisation or open source project and it will automatically be included for Round 1. 

With a pilot fund of **10,000€**, we are aware that this can only be a drop in the ocean considering the 2,200+ projects on OpenSustain.tech. Our goal is to spark a broader conversation about building a sustainable ecosystem for open source solutions tackling global environmental challenges. 

## Preparing for Round 2 

We believe that investing in the right open source projects can create a **cascading effect**, amplifying impact and accelerating sustainable transformation. We can no longer rely on black-box knowledge creation, because the decisions we make today are so critical. That’s why this first funding round is just the beginning. 

Our long-term plan is to build a network of organizations and individuals who share our commitment to building a fund that distributes resources transparently and equitably into climate change relevant open source projects. By applying open science principles on the distribution decision process we analyse where our investment creates the most global impact for the open source ecosystem. Instead of providing seed funding for new development, we want to provide a basic income for the open source projects that are proving to be the basic infrastructure for computing in this area. 

Similar to our [first report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protontypes/open-source-in-environmental-sustainability/main/OpenSourceSustainabilityEcosystem_080423.pdf), we combine **quantitative methods** with **qualitative insights** to identify where funding can have the greatest effect. By using projects data like dependents, citations, downloads, [Development Distribution Score](https://report.opensustain.tech/chapters/development-distribution-score) or issue frequency, we aim to evaluate and maximize the impact of individual projects. By combining our data with interviews, gab analytics and urgency analytics for curtain topics identified as part of the [IPBES](https://www.ipbes.net/global-assessment) and [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) reports, we are releasing a detalied open science report how our distribution metric has been created. But this time we’re not stopping at analysis—we’re turning these insights into outcomes.

Thanks to the support of **[Ecosyste.ms Funds](https://funds.ecosyste.ms/)** and **[Open Source Collective](https://oscollective.org/)**, we will have the right technology partners to channel funds directly to all organisations, projects and their dependencies identified on OpenSustain.tech within Round 2 based on 100% open source software. But scaling this effort requires more than technology - it requires a collective effort. 

## Join Us in Disrupting the Status Quo
